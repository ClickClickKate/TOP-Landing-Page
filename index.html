            <p>Earth's crust is what we walk on every day. It is the thin (relatively) outermost layer that wraps around the Earth and ranges in temperature from 500 to 1,000°C. The crust is split into two types, continental and oceanic. Earth's crust is 5 to 70 km thick.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="infobox">
            <img src="./images/EarthMantle.png"/>
            <p>Just below the crust lies the mantle. The mantle is semi-liquid, sort of like a malleable plastic and makes up 84% of Earth's volume. Earth's mantle is 2,900 km thick and is broken down into 3 main zones, the lithosphere, asthenosphere, and mesosphere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="infobox">
            <img src="./images/InnerCore.png"/>
            <p>The outer core lies beneath the mantle. This liquid iron and nickel layer spins as the planet rotates and creates Earth's magnetic field. This magnetic field helps to protect us from the Sun's solar radiation. The outer core is 2,200 km thick and very hot at up to 6,100°C!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="infobox">
            <img src="./images/OuterCore.png"/>
            <p>The inner core is the deepest layer on Earth. It is also made up of iron and nickel but the pressure is so high that it is no longer liquid. The temperatures in the inner core are as hot as the surface of the sun, about 5505 °C. Earth's inner core is 1,230 to 1,530 km thick.</p>
